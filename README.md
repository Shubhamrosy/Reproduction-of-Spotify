I am building a reproduction of the popular music streaming service Spotify using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project will allow users to browse and listen to music, create playlists, and share their music with friends. I will use the following technologies to build the project:

HTML to define the structure of the website
CSS to style the website and make it look good
JavaScript to add interactivity to the website and make it functional
Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a popular and lightweight IDE that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It has a lot of features that are useful for web development, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting.
I have a special announcment that you can use songs and cover according to your choice
